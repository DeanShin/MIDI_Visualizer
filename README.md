# MIDI_Visualizer
## ![Example Usage](examples/videos/sample_midi.gif)
## Inputs

```python ./MIDI_project.py --tbs 1.2 --tbe 1.4 --spd 5 --rcd Y```

In command line, MIDI_Visualizer uses a parser to parse commands from the user.

```--tbs``` takes a float of time (seconds) before the visualizer receives the first message.  
```--tbe``` takes a float of time (seconds) before the visualizer ends the program after receiving the final message.  
```--spd``` takes an int and affects the downward speed of the notes.  
```--rcd``` takes a Y/N input and affects whether the program records and outputs the visualization as an mp4 file to the video folder.  
```--col1``` takes a hex color code i.e. "#00CC00" 

## Known Problems

On MacOS, the code 
```python
player = pygame.midi.Output(0)
player.set_instrument(0)
```
does not work.

## Code Description

MIDI_Visualizer uses a couple of external libraries--the most important one being Mido.  
Normally, when you try to open a [**MIDI**](https://www.midi.org/) file in, say, a text editor, it ends up looking like a jumbled *mess*:  

![jumbled mess](/examples/screenshots/example-of-a-raw-midi-file.png)  

Not only that, but the MIDI docs are pretty unparseable themselves.  

This is why I decided to use an external library to parse my MIDI files. After researching my various options, [**Mido**](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) seemed to be the simplest to implement into a program.  

```import mido```  

From the Mido docs, "Mido is a library for working with MIDI messages and ports. Itâ€™s designed to be as straight forward and Pythonic as possible." The Mido site has a couple of example programs, one of which served as the basis for my code:  

```python
mid = mido.MidiFile('song.mid')
for msg in mid.play():
    port.send(msg)
```

Which I changed into  

```python
mid = mido.MidiFile(filepath)
for msg in mid.play():
    print(msg)
```

The first line, ```mid = mido.MidiFile(pathToMidi)```, makes ```MidiFile``` object ```mid``` from a MIDI file located at a certain ```filepath```. ```mid``` contains ```messages```, which can then be iterated through, i.e. ```for msg in mid.play()```.  

```mid.play()``` is a function that outputs messages, waiting for the correct amount of time according to each message's ```time``` attribute. This function is good and all for normal and simple usage, however as you'll see later, there are many problems that appear later.

(Note: there are several types of messages, the largest sub-divisions being ```messages``` and ```meta_messages```, ```meta_messages``` hold special information such as when the pedal turns on/off, or lyrics, or the name of an instrument; therefore the ```mid.play()``` function by default does not output ```meta_messages```.)  

With a couple (read: _lots_) of `if` statements, you can easily separate all message types into performing unique functions:
```python
if msg.type == 'note_on' or msg.type == 'note_off':
    #DO SOMETHING
    pass
elif msg.is_meta == False:
    if msg.type == 'control_change':
        #SUSTAIN PEDAL
        if msg.control == 64:
            pass
        else:
            print("Unimplemented control change" + "\n" + "\n")
    else:
        print("Unimplemented message type" + "\n" + "\n")
else:
    #is metaMessage
    print("Unimplemented MetaMessage" + "\n \n")
```

The next step after parsing the MIDI files is to find some way to display them. Following the tried and true methods, I took programs such as [**Synthesia**](https://www.synthesiagame.com/) as inspiration for my own program.  

But first of all, how do you display something in python? The answer is a library such as [**pygame**](https://www.pygame.org/news).  

Pygame is a bit complicated to get in to, however once you learn the basics, it is extremely easy to quickly implement visuals into a program. There are a couple of fundamental lines of code that are necessary for many programs in ```pygame```.  

To initialize,
```python
pygame.init()                                   # initialize all imported pygame modules
pygame.display.set_caption('MIDI Project')      # set the current window caption
window_dims = (1760, 990)                       # width and height
window = pygame.display.set_mode(window_dims)   # initialize a window or screen for display
background = (63,63,63)                         # a color, in this case, in RGB.
FPS = 30.0                                      # frames per second
clock = pygame.time.Clock()                     # create an object to help track time
```
then, in a loop,
```python
while True:
    pygame.display.flip()                       # update the full display Surface to the screen
    clock.tick(FPS)                             # update the clock
    window.fill(background)                     # fill Surface with a solid color
```
This will create a basic gray background that updates at a max of 30.0 frames per second. You can then ```pygame.Surface.blit()``` one surface onto another surface (think of it like pasting one image on top of another), or ```pygame.draw.rect()``` to draw a rectangle onto a given surface.

The majority of my visualizer is comprised of rectangles, so ```pygame.draw.rect()``` gets a _lot_ of use.

## Structure  

While there are many types of messages and meta_messages, the two most common are `note_on` and `note_off`. Every `note_on` and `note_off` message has 5 variables: `type`, `channel`, `note`, `velocity`, and `time`.

Strangely, many MIDI files do not utilize the ```note_off``` type message. Instead, two ```note_on``` type messages are sent--the first one signifies the start of the note, the second one signifies the end. In this system, you can not activate a note that is already activated.  

```

```

A NotePath consists of one piano key and the notes that fall onto it. As there are 88 keys on your standard piano, (plus one for the sustain pedal) there are 89 NotePath objects in the array ```note_paths[]```.
```python
i = 0
note_paths = []
while i < 89:
    #i - 1 in NotePath() accounts for NotePath 0 being the path for the pedal
    note_paths.append(NotePath(i - 1, window_dims, int(args["spd"]), col1, col2, BUBBLES))
    i += 1
del(i, col1, col2)
```  

Each ```NotePath``` object holds an array ```notes``` that comprises of active (currently being drawn) ```NoteObj```:  
```self.notes = [NoteObj]```  

...and a ```PianoRollObj``` corresponding to the position of the NotePath in the array:  
```self.piano_roll_obj = PianoRollObj(self.x, note_id, window)```  

Each ```NoteObj``` falls at a certain speed, and has a certain color calculated according the ```velocity``` of the note, with a linear transformation applied to it.
```python
def lin_map_vel(velocity):
    if velocity == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return (float(velocity - min_vel)/float(max_vel - min_vel + 1))
```   
```python
def __init__(lin_map_vel, col1, col2):
    # making note color change as velocity changes
    self.color = (int(col1[0] + lin_map_vel * (col2[0] - col1[0])), \
    int(col1[1] + lin_map_vel * (col2[1] - col1[1])), \
    int(col1[2] + lin_map_vel * (col2[2] - col1[2])))
```
